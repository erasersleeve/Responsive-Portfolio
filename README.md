## Methodology

My goal was to make a responsive portfolio site in bootstrap. I needed 3 pages in total, and used my main index as a starting point. Each page is essentially made of a nav bar, content, and a footer. The navbar and footer are quite simple: the nav bar contains links to various pages and is responsive to device size, and the sticky foot simply relays a message.

The main page ("index.html) is my about me, and is a simple header and inline img with some text in the grid system. The contact page contains a form to send a message with an email input for responses, but is not yet entirely functional. And the portfolio page is set up to provide links to various projects, though those links are currently unassigned.All the pages size to various devices and should be wholy responsive.
