## Methodology

My goal was to make a responsive portfolio site in bootstrap. I needed 3 pages in total, and used my main index as a starting point. Each page is essentially made of a nav bar, content, and a footer. The navbar and footer are quite simple: the nav bar contains links to various pages and is responsive to device size, and the sticky foot simply relays a message.

The main page ("index.html) is my about me, and is a simple header and inline img with some text in the grid system. The contact page contains a form to send a message with an email input for responses, but is not yet entirely functional. And the portfolio page is set up to provide links to various projects, though those links are currently unassigned.All the pages size to various devices and should be wholy responsive. 

## Links

Link to deployed application: https://erasersleeve.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/

## Screenshots

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.

* Use an HTML validation service to ensure that each page has valid HTML.

### Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.


### Bonus

* Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation).
